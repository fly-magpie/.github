## ✨ The Problem We Solve

Executives and teams receive **30+ critical reports weekly** from different SaaS tools - buried in emails, mixed formats, different schedules. Important insights get lost, and hours are wasted collecting and analyzing data.

## 💡 Our Solution

Set up your Magpie email (`reports@company.magpie.report`), update your SaaS report settings once, and let our AI:
- 📊 Automatically organize all your reports
- 🤖 Extract and analyze key insights
- 📱 Make data queryable via WhatsApp
- 📈 Generate smart summaries
- ⚡ Alert you about important trends
